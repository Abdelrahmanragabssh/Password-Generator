This project is a Java Console Application to generate Random passwords.

Generating a Password:

The user must answer by Yes or No the questions to know if he desires to use Uppercase/Lowercase letters, Numbers or Symbols
The user then enters the desired length of the password
A password alphabet is generated according to the Yes/No answers it is a String that contains the choices of the user
Depending on the length random characters from the password alphabet are selected and put back to back to form a totally random string according to the user's needs
The randomly generated password is then displayed on the console
